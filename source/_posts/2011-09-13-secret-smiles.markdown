### July Story, Part Three

However, despite being too young to share his smiles, he still
sometime has them. From very early on he had a "secret smile" that 
passed across his face for no apparent reason:

I still do not know for sure, but I got a hint one day when I happened 
to be changing his diaper. I looked up to see a grin on his face, and 
looked down to see a golden stream appear!
