### July Story, Part Twelve

[![Something Blue][44]][44a]

Wait, that's for weddings... well, it is even more true for
babies. Maybe they force you to borrow something for your wedding to
get practice for having a blue-eyed baby. Everything Lev is wearing in
this picture is a gift from someone. The polka dotted shirt is from my
mother, the mat he is lying on from Arthur and Kelly Gleckler, and the
blanket from the hospital <!--more--> (I unexpectedly stayed overnight, and since
it was colder in the morning when I was ready to go home than I had
prepared for, they gave me a blanket. I tried to give it back later
but they wouldn't take back something that had been out of the
hospital.) Its hard to survive with a first baby without help. I am
particularly grateful to my mom for making a special trip to help me
get through the hardest first month, and for dealing with me when 
I was grouchy from extreme sleep deprivation.
