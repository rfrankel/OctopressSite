### July Story, Part Five

Enough with obsession with the baby! you may say. What about the parents? 

I've tried to get Alexey involved by giving him bottles of expressed
milk so he can feed and burp the baby too. Burping is my least
favorite baby task.  I thought I wouldn't like changing diapers, but I
have developed a fascination with baby poo. It is, after all, the
final product of all my hard work, by which I can measure how well I'm
doing. God, I can't believe I said that.

At first Alexey only helped with the diapers, but I worried that was
unrewarding. As he said "Mommy is the source of all good things, Daddy
is the sink for all bad things." So, as I mentioned, I tried to give
him bottles so he could be a source of milk too.
