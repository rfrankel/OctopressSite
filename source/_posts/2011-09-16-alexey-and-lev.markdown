### July Story, Part Five

Enough with obsession with the baby! you may say. What about the parents? 

I've tried to get Alexey involved by giving him bottles of expressed
milk so he can feed and burp the baby too. Burping is my least
favorite baby task.  I thought I wouldn't like changing diapers, but I
have developed a fascination with baby poo. It is, after all, the
final product of all my hard work, by which I can measure how well I'm
doing. God, I can't believe I said that.

At first Alexey only helped with the diapers, but I worried that was
unrewarding. As he said "Mommy is the source of all good things, Daddy
is the sink for all bad things." <!--more--> So, as I mentioned, I tried to give
him bottles so he could be a source of milk too.

Here you see him burping the baby. As I said, I hate burping. The kid
is wailing his heart out, and all you can do is pat him on the back
and emote at him desperately "it will all be OK if only you are a
little bit patient!" I feel like an idiot. Then when he does burp, he
gets this funny look on his face as if he suddenly feels stupid for
making such a big deal over such a small thing. Here you see Alexey
and the baby with his Post Burp Face:

The good part of burping is that he often gets quite happy afterward
all the dust has settled (and why shouldn't he -- full tummy, no more
gas?) But the next time he never remembers that he his on the path to 
Post Burp Happiness, and wails his heart out all over again.
