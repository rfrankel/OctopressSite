### July Story, Part Nine

[![Anne and Baby][31]][31a]

My mother Anne came for the first month, and her help was invaluable,
both as a birth partner and keeping ordinary life humming. <!--more--> The last
weekend we wanted to give her a little chance to be a real tourist in
Ireland, so we rented a car and went to the tourist spot of her
choice, which turned out to be Newgrange & Knowth, one of the most
spectacular prehistoric burial sites. We saw an underground stone room
older than the pyramids, older than Stonehenge. The baby was much
admired by passerbys, for it is rare to see a baby that small
(perhaps with good reason, I worried, but the trip did not seem to
hurt his health, and in fact soon after his weight gain accelerated.)
