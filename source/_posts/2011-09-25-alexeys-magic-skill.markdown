### July Story, Part Six

I read an [essay][4T] which said that Dads are [better][DAD] than Moms
at soothing colicky babies, so I sent Alexey a description of the
technique of swaddling and shushing. It seems to be true -- if the
baby cries normally, because he's hungry or cold or wet, I'm the one
who can calm him, but if he gets sufficiently worked up, or is crying
out of pure Weltschmertz, it is Alexey who has the magic touch.
