The purpose of this blog is to share news, stories and pictures of our
new son, born 9:17 Irish time Sunday June 26th. The first bit of news
is the name we have chosen for him: Lev Anatoly (Alexeyvich) Radul.

(Note: the old contents of alexeyandrebecca.com are [still available][OLD], though
out of date at this point.)

Why Lev? I wanted something versatile that was appropriate for our
ancestry but wouldn't necessarily lock the kid into any particular
interpretation of it. Lev is simultaniously a Russian and a Hebrew
name - meaning "lion" in Russian and "heart" in Hebrew. When I learned
it was Tolstoy's Russian name, that clinched it for me. If the kid
decides it sounds too foreign, it can easily be "translated" into
English as Leo, just like Tolstoy did, but he can also choose to claim
its proud Russian heritage. Its meaning as "lion" is also a double
ancestor tribute, because Alexey has a godfather Leonid ("lion" in
Greek) and I had a grandfather Ari ("lion" in Hebrew.)

I also like the sound of the Russian nickname: when Alexey says "Leva"
it is reminiscent to me of the middle syllables of "beloved". The name
itself sounds like an endearment. But with the Americanized
pronunciation it sounds plenty tough and manly too. It can be made to 
sound softer or harder depending on the occasion: such versatility is 
rare in a short name.

Anatoly was chosen because Alexey liked "A" names and I liked the
nickname "Tolya". I think Alexey likes being "Alexey Andrevich" -- he
just likes the ring of it, so he wanted to continue the alliterative
tradition making his son "Anatoly Alexeyevich." Another Russian "A"
name was a not-so-overt way of hinting at "Andrey the Third" -- there
is some ancestor tribute in this too.  But Tanya worried that Anatoly
is too irredeemably foreign, and unlike Lev it has no English
translation, so it got demoted to a middle name.

Finally, the initials LAR or LAAR (depending on whether one includes
the patronymic) satified our desire for something pronouncable but
not an actual word.
