### July Story, Part Four

He has other expressions too: unlike adults, he doesn't censor the
expression of his feeling, and his face is remarkably mobile. I was
surprised how much communication there is with a baby who can't yet
talk or even understand what he sees. It is what has made what would I
would otherwise consider a harrowing month actually surprisingly rewarding. Here
is a sequence showing his range of expression:


[![Range of Expression I][6]][6a]
[![Range of Expression II][7]][7a]
[![Range of Expression III][8]][8a]
[![Range of Expression IV][9]][9a]
[![Range of Expression V][10]][10a]
[![Range of Expression VI][11]][11a]
[![Range of Expression VII][12]][12a]
[![Range of Expression IV][13]][13a]
[![Range of Expression IV][14]][14a]

(These were taken very early: note the hospital name band and the eyes that are green rather than blue from the remnants of jaundice. The pictures from the previous post were taken a bit later, after the jaundice cleared and his eyes had returned to baby blue --- much to my relief.)
