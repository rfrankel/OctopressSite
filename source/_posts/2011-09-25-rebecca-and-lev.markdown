### July Story, Part Ten

So we have seen Baby, Daddy, and Grandma. What about Mommy?

I am much improved. When I saw myself in the mirror in the maternity 
ward, I was rather frightened, but then I realized that no one looks 
good in a maternity ward. <!--more--> The Hollywood actresses who put on a pregnancy 
suit, cry a bunch at the "delivery" and then get out of bed looking like 
Hollywood actresses do not exist in real life. 

So there is the new me: me with small person. Boy, does he look small.
Its cute, but it worries me -- the big story of the month is my
struggle to get him gaining weight, and with the medical system to get
them to give me a remedy I was comfortable with. I'm surprised to find
that when it comes to medical philosophy I seem to tend toward the
nutty crunchy: natural remedies, vitamins, no strong drugs, etc. I'm
not always like that -- if I was facing cancer I'd want something
stronger than vitamins -- but baby growth is not a disease. 

Anyway, the baby first had a bought of jaundice (probably made worse
by my unfriendly blood type, AB) and then struggled with reflux. For
that I found one medicine that was a lifesaver, Gaviscon or sodium
alginate, which isn't really a medicine at all, because its action is
purely physical, not chemical. Its agar! It makes his tummy contents
thicker so they don't bubble around and bother him as much. After he
got alginated his growth finally took off. Maybe before that his food
hurt him so he was using it more as antiacid than as nourishment. He
wasn't a happy camper and I was going crazy too. As I mentioned,
Anne's help was invaluable, and I also owe a lot to the nurse who
helped me figure out what was the problem.

The first picture was a weight he seemed stuck at forever, 3.19kg,
which was very bad because he was already supposed to have regained
his birthweight 3.38kg by that time.  The second picture was the day
he finally broke his birthweight again --- a week and half late.
Nonetheless I was very happy to see it.
