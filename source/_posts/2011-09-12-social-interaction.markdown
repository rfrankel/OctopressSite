He's slowly moving toward social interaction: at first he didn't look
at anything particularly, then he started looking for food, somewhat
later he started looking at faces, but only with a puzzled expression,
then finally he learned to interact and met an expression with another
expression.  However, to his mommy's chagrin, his main use of this
trick so far is to sniffle and beg. <!--more--> His emotional life so far has been
centered around food (with perhaps a bit of the Trauma of Pooping
thrown in). I don't begrudge him this focus, especially since I am so
worried about his weight gain.

This is a series showing this kind of interaction (with Alexey because
I was holding the camera). Sticking his tongue out in the second picture
is his way of begging for food, but since Alexey had none, the expressions 
in the third pictures expression ensued.
